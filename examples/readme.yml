  - I can convert YAML to Mind Maps:
    - I use GraphViz and Pydot
    - My YAMLs are more convinient to write
    - My Nodes are sill customizable
    - "I accept colons: look at me"
    - |
      I accept allignment of lists:
      - Look at me
      - Just look at me
        * I'm awesome

  - I can set default customizations via themes:
    - Themes are also YAMls
    - Themes are dynamic:
      - Filter nodes:
        - With Python predicates
        - With Regexps
      - Control styles with priorities
      - Override styles in the Mind Map description

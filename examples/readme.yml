    - I can convert YAML to Mind Maps:
        - I use GraphViz and Pydot
        - My YAMLs are more convinient to write
        - My Nodes are sill customizable
    - I can set default customizations via themes:
        - Themes are also YAMls

            - Filter nodes:
                - With Python predicates
                - With Regexps
            - Control styles with priorities
            - Override styles in the Mind Map description
